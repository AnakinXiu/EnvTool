## Generating documentation

The documentation is generated by **[Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html)**
via the `envtool.Doxyfile` config-file.

Running the command `doxygen envtool.Doxyfile`, requires `hhc.exe`.
This is part of the **[Microsoft HTML Workshop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21138)**.
This will generate a compressed HTML-file of the generated documentation `envtool.chm`
which can be view by the command `start envtool.chm`. Or loaded in the
excellent **[KchmViewer](http://www.ulduzsoft.com/linux/kchmviewer/getting-kchmviewer/)**.

The commands can be either:
```
make all   - should produce envtool.chm in this directory.
make clean - should delete all generated files.
```

PS. This file is written with the aid of the **[Atom](https://atom.io/)**
editor and it's **[Markdown-Preview](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview)**.
A real time-saver.
